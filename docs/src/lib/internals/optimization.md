# Optimization

## Interface

The interface that has to be implemented for an optimization algorithm.

```@autodocs
Modules = [GraphComputing]
Pages = ["optimization/interface.jl"]
Order = [:type, :constant, :function]
```

## Random Walk Optimizer

Implementation of a random walk algorithm.

```@autodocs
